After the initial assessment and strategizing, customers often request a Proof of Concept (PoC) 
to validate 
1)the technical feasibility,
2)business impact,
3)and organizational readiness for the new solution.

After PoC iterate the strategy and evalautaion phase process.he following are the main activities during the PoC phase,
along with their goals.

Define PoC success criteria.
Deﬁne a specific and measurable outcome from the PoC that will eﬀectively show it was successful.
Deﬁne the design criteria and readiness for the PoC from a systems and data perspective.

Evaluate data readiness
Ask your customer: "Are you having any challenges with how your data is currently stored?"

Continue Ops model planning
In the Strategy and Evaluation phase, you may have started discussing model selection with your customer.
During the PoC phase,Ops model planning will continue, and the following can occur.
        Identify parameters that maximize performance metrics (for example, price, latency, and accuracy).
        Adapt the chosen model, the selection from pre-training, fine tuning, or in-context learning.
        Plan the implementation, confirm technical feasibility, and assess the ROI.
        Identify and select the model features that perform best for the specific use case scenario.
        Potentially build multiple versions of a POC to compare different components.
Plan to progress from PoC to Implementation
        Have a clear understanding of end goals and next steps early on in the PoC design phase. 
        Ensure that your customers can integrate end goals into their PoC approach as needed, minimizing
        the risk of stalling in the PoC phase (also known as PoC purgatory).
        The plan may include understanding key stakeholders, budgets for the project, resource availability or constraints,
        and having a timeline to show the business results and impact. 

To stay within project scope, ensure that you have your responsible guard rails in place. 

Standard metrics include:

Top Line revenue impact – Grow sales by adding new value added offerings and win new customers.
Bottom Line – Reduce product costs and finance and administrative costs.
Intangible or Subjective – Stay relevant with tech, customer sentiment, and satisfaction rates.

Customers may face the challenge of ending up in PoC purgatory if they have not definitively 
reached the goals of the preliminary activities presented earlier

So it's important to ensure that all leadership teams are aligned on the goals and success outcomes 
of the project during both the Strategy and PoC phases.
During the PoC phase, some top challenges and considerations for customers include:
Complex workflows:
The interdependence of workflows increases the risk of errors that spread across systems. 
Data is not seamlessly integrated and data does not flow well across business units.
Poor data quality
Poor quality data imposes a barrier to at-scale adoption.
Siloed data architecture
Legacy data silos obstruct efficient access to unified data that is essential for ML model training and fine-tuning
Legal and cybersecurity issues
Sensitive data must be handled correctly, even during the PoC phase.

what partners can do?
Partners can help customers complete necessary tasks and address a few of the considerations in 
this phase by taking the following actions.

Create a standardized PoC offering for customers that:
Includes a defined scope with a timeline to avoid PoC purgatory
Is included in your marketplace (such as blueprints and startup kits) 
Has customizable options for specific industry and use cases
Takes into account your customer's data readiness. A consistent roadblock from moving to PoC to 
implementation is data readiness.

Implementation Phase:
The Implementation phase is the transition from a PoC to a fully operational generative AI solution. The solution must meet your customer's organizational needs and achieve the goals
defined during the Strategy & Evaluation phase
During the Implementation phase, consider the operational aspect of the generative AI solution in production. This includes verifying that upstream and downstream systems are operational without failure and there is governance in place,
according to the enterprise standards and requirements.

The following are the main activities during the Implementation phase, along with their goals.
Orchestration
This involves the automated configuration, coordination, and management of systems and processes. 
Orchestration is critical to successfully scale a generative AI implementation
Actions: 

    Provide a consistent API interface
    Perform prompt chaining 
    Integrate multiple large language models (LLMs) pipelines
    Take action to the external system
Data Preparations
Good quality, well-organized data is essential to the success of a generative AI implementation
Guardrails;
Guardrails are a way to keep a process in line with expectations. In the case of generative AI, they are the filters, rules, and tools that sit between inputs, the model, and outputs. 
Guardrails are implemented to safeguard an application's requirements and ensure responsible AI policies.

Actions: Reduce the likelihood of erroneous or toxic outputs and unexpected formats, such as hallucinations and jailbreaking, 
through prompt engineering. Validate foundation model (FM) outputs through declarative statements on measurable features

Organizational change management
Change management is a set of processes designed to help customers successfully implement their generative AI solutions and manage any reorganization. The goal of change management is to ensure success by creating a comprehensive 
plan to launch and track the impact of the generative AI implementation.
