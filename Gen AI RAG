What exactly is a RAG and how does it reduce risk?
RAG is one of the fastest ways to use your custom data to customize the outputs of an existing model that was not
made with your specific data set in mind.

With RAG, or retrieval augmented generation, there is no need to retrain that model 
and the external data used to augment your prompts can come from multiple data sources including document repositories,
databases, and APIs

he thing is that using RAG reduces the risk of undesired results by adjusting its output to the data retrieved 
from knowledge libraries. So, in a nutshell, centralizing and normalizing your data should be your first step as 
you build a gen AI plan with a goal of getting to production as quickly as possible.
