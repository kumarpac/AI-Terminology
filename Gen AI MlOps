Intro to MLOps:
MLOps is the combination of people, processes, and technology to productionize ML solutions efficiently.
MLOps involves streamlining and optimizing the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of ML models in production environments. 

What MLOps can do?
1)MLOps help customers identify systematic, repeatable solutions to any challenges or lack of efficiencies they might 
experience around people, processes, data, or technology.
2)MLOps bridges the gap between machine learning development and operationalization, ensuring that models are deployed 
quickly and remain reliable, scalable, and secure in production.
People:Lack of correct training and operating model.
Process:Manual handovers, governance, and long time-to-value.
Data:Data-discovery and access difficulty
Technology:-Fragmented and out-of-date environments

Model management:customers to have internal operational processes that ensure managing model versioning, monitoring model performance, ensuring data
and model integrity, and addressing ethical considerations surrounding the use of these transformative AI technologies.
Model Evaluation: There are unique considerations to evaluating foundation model outputs when your customers donâ€™t have labeled test data. 
In this situation approaches such as human-in-the-loop (HIL) and LLM powered evaluation need to be considered.
