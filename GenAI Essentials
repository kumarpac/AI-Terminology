GenAI is high in demand, but how you will deploy in safe, trusted mananer
Ready to begin... let's get started....
GenAI has captured our attention and imgination
This is a paradigm
Generative AI key drivers
    - scalable Compute capacity
    - Massive proliferation Data growth
    - Rapid advancement of ML technology accelerated the shift.modern sophistication technology

Businesses arcoss the industry rapidly adopting ML technology to trnsform their businesses
This is really exciting time, many customer experiences  their applications are reinvented through GenAI.
ML drives manay of the capabilities...
ML inovation is a Amazon DNA.
AWS ML powers E-commerce, recommendation engine, forcasting, capacity planning.computer vision technologies..


What is GenAI- It is a type of Artifical Intelligence, capable in creating new content and ideas including 
conversation, image, story, video and music.

GenAI is powered by ML Model

Traditional Model - customers needs to gather label data, train model and deploy the model. This must be repeated for
each specific tasks.

Foundation Model-Instead of gathering label data for each model and training multiple models. Customer can use same pre-trained
model to adopt  multiple tasks
Customer can even differentiate their business by customizing FM to perform domain specific functions..

Types of Foundation model in the market..
text-to-text- summarize text, extract information, respond to questions, create content like blog
sentence auto completioin
text-to-embeddings- comparing user request with catalog data.
multimodal- Text and images

Key AI generative service.

Why customer should AWS platform for GenAI
    Broadest choice of foundation models.
    Purpose built infrastructure to help you scale

AWS generative AI is a stack of technologies . The stack consists of 3 macro layers

1) Applications that leverage LLMs and Others FMs
Amazon Q(Business) developer, QuickSight
2) Tools To build with LLMs And others FMs
AWS Bedrock
3) Infrastructure for FM training and inference
GPUs, Trainium, Inferentia,SageMaker, ultraCluster,Nitro, Neuron

Amazon Q:  A generative AIâ€“powered assistant designed for work that can be tailored  to meet business needs

Top layer
The top layer provides generative AI applications that customers can use to 
work with FMs without specialized knowledge or coding

Middle layer
The middle layer provides tools, like Amazon Bedrock, that can be used to customize and train 
FMs for customers seeking to develop generative AI applications. 
This tier also assists customers in evaluating, selecting, and consuming these models through 
various distribution channels.

Bottom layer




Amazon Q Developer helps developers quickly write secure code by generating whole-line
and full-function code suggestions in an integrated development environment (IDE).
