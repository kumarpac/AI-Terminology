      -and every operational aspect of an organization. 

Industory Applications
Generative AI adoption maturity varies across industries (verticals) and organizational functions (horizontals). 
There are hundreds of AI and generative AI use cases across industries
1) life science & healthcare : Protein folding and drug design
2) Industrial and manufacturing: design parts and  material design
3) Financial services:Risk managment & fraud detection
4) Retail: product review summaries & chatbots
5) Media and entertainment: Video game generation and media content improvement

Gen AI adoption journey - customers are facing seven key challenges
- whar to build
    -Technology
    -Early adoption
-How to Build
   - data 
   - Architectural options
   - legal & cybersecurity
-How to Scale
    - Day2 operations
    -Organizational Change Management

As a reminder, the seven key challenges customers face when adopting generative AI are: 
  Developing a technology strategy, 
  Prioritizing use cases, 
  Ensuring data quality/availability, 
  Evaluating architectural options, 
  Addressing legal and cybersecurity considerations, 
  Managing day-2 operations, and 
  Leading change management.

Why the Value Proposition of AWS Resonates with Customers?
Delivering for customers
AWS customers want to quickly take advantage of present and future generative AI opportunities within their business processes.
However, it can be a challenge to integrate this technology into business processes and realize its value
  The broadest choice of foundational models for every use case
       Individual customers may need access to various models. 
       They need the flexibility to optimize for cost, performance, and latency for different types of use 
       cases and applications.
 solutions: offering a broad choice of leading FMs from companies including Amazon, AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta,
            Mistral AI, and Stability AI through a single API. 
Easy-to-use tools for every type of customer
   To remain agile, organizations across all industries, company sizes, and developers of all skill levels 
   need access to a variety of tools. These tools help organizations build and scale generative AI applications, 
   no matter where they are in their journey.
   Challenge: Generative AI deployment and architecture options are not a one-size-fits-all. 
   Customers will choose different ways to deploy generative AI.
   AWS has offerings across the stack. For instance,
    if your customers want to build applications with existing FMs in a secure and private environment
            AWS offers Amazon Bedrock
    if your customer is looking to quickly take advantage of generative AI and increase employee productivity,
            there is Amazon Q.
     if they want to build, train, and deploy their own FM, AWS provides
            Amazon SageMaker.
Purpose-built infrastructure to help you scale
  To generate more accurate results, generative AI workloads are using larger and larger datasets that require high-performant compute,
  storage, and networking resources at scale to handle the sheer volume of data.
  Challenge: Whether customers are training their own models, customizing models, or running ML applications, 
  they need to train and run inference at scale with an infrastructure that is purpose-built for ML.
  Solution: AWS invested heavily in purpose-built accelerators such as AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia, 
  to provide the most performant and low-cost infrastructure for generative AI.

A comprehensive set of data services
  To use data for generative AI, it must be organized and accessible.

application allows AI to become a design assistant, providing inspiration for designers and 
improving the efficiency of producing rendered images
