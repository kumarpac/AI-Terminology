The purpose of this conversation 
to help customers start thinking about generative AI solutions now, and provide data around the impacts 
of growing and modernizing their business with generative AI. 

-to ask how the company is navigating the topic of generative AI today
- to ask about the investments they are making in data and AI.
- next informed the customer of industry specific insights relevant to the company around the trends and outlook in generative AI.
  This helps the customer understand the importance and potential of generative AI in their business.

-how Amazon Q manages my data:
Amazon Q provides access control policies with roles and identities. So, if data access is denied outside of Q,

or Amazon Q Business plans, no data is used to improve the underlying models for others. So your data is your differentiator.

Questions: how do I keep my data secure when using generative AI? And second is how do I explain the results? 
          how do we get comfortable with system generated outputs, especially under generative AI, 
          where the reasoning for the answers isn't always clear?
          you can retrain models with knowledge-based content periodically; or you can also use some cost effective AI techniques
          like retrieval augmented generation, or RAG. But regardless of retraining models or using RAG, 
          having people in the loop to verify and reinforce the model is also usually something that I recommend
